Chat GPT Prompt"After creating objectg and highlighting it I want to move it "



A. Layer as Canvas Layer
I have problem now in my code, we can make new layer by adding layer but It is not really related with actual Drawing.
If I click layer 1 and draw something in layer1, The objects should be only in layer 1.
If I click layer2 It should be empty layer.

If I click Layer1 and 2 together then both things should be show up together


B.Layer as Object Layer


If there is no selection button,
Problem
1.untoggle status should be Drag or  
2.
